//This method prevents you from modifying existing object properties or adding new properties and values to an object. Itâ€™s often what people think const does, however const allows you to modify an object.
//Example: Freeze an object to prevent the name property from being changed.


const frozenObject = {
  name: 'Hector'
}

Object.freeze(frozenObject);

frozenObject.name = 'Norza';
console.log(frozenObject);

//Result should be: {name: "Hector"}
